# IMG Text Scanner

## Problem

- Employees might store personal images on the company computer.
- When the employee leaves, the company got to make sure there are no sensitive documents. This web app aims to utilise optical character recognition to detect any text in an image. This will significantly reduce the time to go through all the unnecessary images (i.e. selfies and cat images).

## How to use

- Upload images, click scan and wait.
- Once done, images that was flag will be displayed on the screen.
